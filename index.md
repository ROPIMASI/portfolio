# DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO
  
#### Welcome to my professional portfolio in GitHubPage version!
Graduated in Computer Science and Technician in Administration, I took advantage of the experience in IT for two years, gradually migrated to administration. It was years of adding knowledge. Today, with knowledge in Business Management and Computing, I feel motivated and prepared for new and greater challenges.  
  
I developed considerable administrative vision, teamwork skills and leadership, which added to the knowledge in Computer Science broaden my range of action and enhance my results, adding value to the IT project team in which I will be part of.  
  
It is **important to highlight**, despite well-defined goals, I have a professional profile of relative flexibility, **never ruling out other segments** of computing, such as, database, operating systems, RPA, IoT, AI, among others.  
  
#### Goals
My short-term goal: working in a java-web software development team.  
  
My long-term goal: working in software project architecture in the data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence segments.
